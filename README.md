# hello-world

This is the first time I really try to use github. I hope it will be fun and I can learn something instresting and useful.


I am not a professional IT guy. I leran to code because I want to learn something and computing looks like to be a tendency. And I am trying to improve my English skills as well.

Hope I can get a lot of fun and learn something.
